PITS is a personalised intelligent tutoring system used to collect answers and build a profile on the user who answers the question.

## Installation

Install all NPM modules used for the client side. Then build the production javascript.

```javascript
cd client
npm install
npm run production

## Development

To run the front-end VueJS in development mode, serve can be used to run a development server. This will enable hot reload.

```javascript
cd client
npm run serve
```
